# Midnight KeyBoard

### Description: 
	Just simple responsive web keyboard for raspberry pi.

### Issue: 
	In situation when you have just an rp with wifi, usb flash, usb/usb mini adaptor, and mouse, problem is connect to wifi, because you cannot put password. You can send it by ssh, but without connection to network you can not do it, for put password you need or ssh, it can be resolved by connection to network by Ethernet, or put it with local keyboard.

### Solution: 
	With this keyboard you can resolve this problem.

### List Requirements:
	- Raspberry Pi
	- USB FLASH Type (3.0 Recommended)
	- Adaptor from usb to usb mini, if you use raspberry pi zero (w)
	- Mouse

### Notice: If you use rp zero, you probably need multiper usb, to connect both mouse and flash

### Installation:
	1) clone this repo in directory you wish.
	2) copy cloned directory to usb flash drive.
	3) your rp must be powered on.
	4) connect your mouse to rp.
	5) connect flash drive to rp.
	6) when you connect usb drive, you will see window with ask you if you want to open flash drive in file manager, type yes, if you can not see this window, you need to use another flash drive.
	7) when flash drive opened just with connected mouse copy or drag keyboard-folder to Desktop or another location you want.
	8) double-click on index.html, and it will opened in browser (in my case it chromium the default).

### Recommendation: I recommend to use rp browser instead chromium, because it runs better with resolution.

### Usage: 
	Unfortunately this is web app, and you can only type text in input tag, for this just click on input, and you can start typing, 
	to see numbers and other symbols just click on 1234..., 
	to back to letters click on abcd..., 
	on bottom area you can find register, like caps lock, it just little arrow, it can get you upper and lower cases.

### p.s. Nice Typing.
